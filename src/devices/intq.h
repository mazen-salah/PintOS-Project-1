/* An "interrupt queue", a circular buffer shared between
   kernel threads and external interrupt handlers.

   Interrupt queue functions can be called from kernel threads or
   from external interrupt handlers.  Except for intq_init(),
   interrupts must be off in either case.

   The interrupt queue has the structure of a "monitor".  Locks
   and condition variables from threads/synch.h cannot be used in
   this case, as they normally would, because they can only
   protect kernel threads from one another, not from interrupt
   handlers. */
